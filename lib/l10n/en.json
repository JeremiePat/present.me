  "Install warning": "present.me needs external dependencies to work: Pandoc and LaTeX.\n\nBecause we don't want to clutter you environnement, we suggest that you install those dependencies yourself in order to stay in control:\n> Pandoc: https://pandoc.org/installing.html\n> LaTeX: http://www.tug.org/texlive/\n  (this is only a suggestion, use the TeX environnement of your choice)\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to add those tools in your environnement. You can install Docker. If so, we will be able to setup a Docker container (https://hub.docker.com/r/pandoc/latex) that will contain all the necessary tools without the hassle of doing it yourself and without altering your environnement.\n\nDocker Community Edition:\n> macos: https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg\n> windows: https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker Desktop Installer.exe\n> For linux users, it depends on your distribution,\n  see: https://docs.docker.com/install/\n\nOnce done, try installing present.me again."
